#Calculations:

#In order to take the Size of the house into account, I found that in average in Europe we have a consumption of 180 kWh/year:

#So we can predict a consumption of: 

energy_sqm = (size_of_house*180)/365

#Now we find the best two consecutives hours to put the appliances by day and if we find that these two hours are by night
#we will need to find the cheapest hours for the day in order to turn ON "Washing_Machine" and "Oven" during the day:

		min_sum = act_sum
		cheapest_hours = element
	  }

#We need to now what is the hour and if it is between 9-18 or 19-7:

 if cheapest_hours < 9 OR cheapest_hours > 18:
